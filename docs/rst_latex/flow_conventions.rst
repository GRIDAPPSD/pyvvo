The example flow chart below presents the conventions that will be used
throughout this documentation. Note that all flow charts are vector
images (specifically, ``.svg``), so you can zoom in on them without
making them blurry.

Technical Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the flow charts are rendering well for you and include text, no need
to read this section.

If you cannot see any text on the flow charts or they don't render
correctly, you're likely using an archaic web browser. Please either
update your browser or switch to a modern one (*e.g.*, Firefox). The
``.svg`` files have the fonts embedded in `WOFF
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format>`__ 2.0 format
(published as a `W3C recommendation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium#W3C_recommendation_(REC)>`__
in 2018) by `dvisvgm <https://dvisvgm.de/>`__.
