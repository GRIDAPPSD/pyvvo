This directory contains LaTex source files for PyVVO documentation
diagrams.

Brandon installed MikTex, then used TexWorks for editing/compiling the
LaTex source files. Compiling via TexWorks by default creates ``.pdf``
output, which cannot be directly integrated into HTML documentation
generated by Sphinx. After trying many different methods of converting
``.pdf`` to ``.svg``, it was found that it's best to compile the
LaTex source files into ``.dvi`` files and then convert the ``.dvi``
files to ``.svg``.

Fortunately, there's a helper function in this directory called
``tex2svg.sh`` to make this simple. Call like ``./tex2svg.sh main_loop``
if you want to convert ``main_loop.tex`` to ``main_loop.svg``.
