latex
=====

This directory contains LaTex source files for PyVVO documentation
diagrams.

**NOTE**: In general, there should be a a ``.rst`` file in the
``docs/rst_latex`` directory for each ``.tex`` file here. An exception
to that rule is with ``flow_base.tex`` which is intended to be
``\input`` into all the ``.tex`` files.

The only files that should be added to the repository itself are the
``.tex`` files. The ``.svg`` files will be placed into
``../html/_images`` at build time.

Setup
-----

Brandon installed MikTex, then used TexWorks for editing/compiling the
LaTex source files. Compiling via TexWorks by default creates ``.pdf``
output, which cannot be directly integrated into HTML documentation
generated by Sphinx. After trying many different methods of converting
``.pdf`` to ``.svg``, it was found that it's best to compile the
LaTex source files into ``.dvi`` files and then convert the ``.dvi``
files to ``.svg``.

Fortunately, there's a helper function in this directory called
``tex2svg.sh`` to make this simple. Call like ``./tex2svg.sh main_loop``
if you want to convert ``main_loop.tex`` to ``main_loop.svg``.
