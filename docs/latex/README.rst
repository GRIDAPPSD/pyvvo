This directory contains LaTex source files for PyVVO documentation
diagrams.

Brandon installed MikTex, then used TexWorks for editing/compiling the
LaTex source files. Compiling via TexWorks by default creates ``.pdf``
output, which cannot be directly integrated into HTML documentation
generated by Sphinx. After trying many different methods of converting
``.pdf`` to ``.svg``, it was found that it's best to compile the
LaTex source files into ``.dvi`` files and then convert the ``.dvi``
files to ``.svg``.

Here's an example of that process, using ``main_loop.tex`` as an
example:

.. code:: bash

    cd ~/git/pyvvo/docs/latex
    latex main_loop.tex
    dvisvgm --font-format==woff2 main_loop.dvi
