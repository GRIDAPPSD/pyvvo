<h1>How PyVVO Works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-pyvvo-works" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section will provide an overview of how PyVVO works by walking
through various flow charts. At times, specific Python modules or
classes will be referenced. In addition to examining the source code
itself, the API is documented in the <a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#pyvvo-code"><span class="std std-ref">PyVVO Code</span></a> section.</p>
<p>PyVVO is <em>highly</em> configurable. To keep this documentation maintainable
and avoid repeating information, the configurable fields will not be
covered in detail here. Instead, check out <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/pyvvo#configuring-pyvvo">this section</a> in the repository’s top-level README file.</p>
<p>Additionally, PyVVO emits logs a significant amount of information as it
runs. Many of PyVVO’s log messages are described in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/pyvvo#viewing-pyvvo-logs-as-simulation-proceeds">this section</a>
of the top-level README.</p>

<h2>Flow Chart Conventions<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-chart-conventions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The example flow chart below presents the conventions that will be used
throughout this documentation. Note that all flow charts are vector
images (specifically, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.svg</span></code>), so you can zoom in on them without
making them blurry. While reading the documentation, it will probably
be most useful if you open up each flow chart in a second window and
position it side by side this documentation.</p>

<h2>High Level Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the highest level, PyVVO contains two important components:
data-driven predictive load modeling and a genetic algorithm. The
load models are layered onto a GridLAB-D model, and resulting GridLAB-D
simulation outputs are used in the genetic algorithm’s optimization
process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-loop">
<h2>Main Loop<a class="headerlink" href="#main-loop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following image depicts a flow chart of the operation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app.py</span></code>
(<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#module-pyvvo.app" title="pyvvo.app"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.app</span></code></a>). Boxes prefaced with <strong>INCOMPLETE</strong> indicate that
more work is needed to finalize the code related to the process
described in the box.</p>
<img alt="_images/main_loop.svg" src="_images/main_loop.svg" /><p>As noted in (a), when PyVVO is running inside the
GridAPPS-D platform, it’s started by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run_pyvvo.py</span></code>
(<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#module-pyvvo.run_pyvvo" title="pyvvo.run_pyvvo"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.run_pyvvo</span></code></a>).</p>
<div class="section" id="initialization-phase">
<span id="init-phase"></span><h3>Initialization Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#initialization-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When PyVVO is started, it only receives two inputs from
the platform: the simulation ID and the
(<a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_gridappsd/index.html#simulation-api">simulation request</a>)
(b). The simulation request contains many useful
details including, but not limited to, the feeder’s MRID, the time span
of the simulation, <em>etc.</em></p>
<p>PyVVO uses the information from (b) to initialize a
variety of classes whose role is to interface with the GridAPPS-D
platform (c). These classes can be found in
<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#module-pyvvo.sparql" title="pyvvo.sparql"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.sparql</span></code></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#module-pyvvo.gridappsd_platform" title="pyvvo.gridappsd_platform"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.gridappsd_platform</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>Since PyVVO is a volt-var optimization application, it primarily cares
about regulators and capacitors (future work should include control of
other devices). However, since PyVVO is model-based, it also needs to
know about other active devices in the system such as photovoltaic
inverters, distributed generators, and switches. PyVVO uses the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SPARQLManager</span></code> (initialized in (c)) to query
the GridAPPS-D platform’s Common Information Model
(<a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_resources/index.html#cim-documentation">CIM</a>)
triplestore database to obtain nominal device information
(c). Additionally, information about the
measurement objects (<em>e.g.</em>, their MRIDs, measurement types, <em>etc</em>.)
associated with the each device is pulled from the CIM triplestore.</p>
<p>With device and measurement information in hand, PyVVO can initialize
objects that represent all the equipment in the system that PyVVO cares
about (e). PyVVO has various classes related to the
management of devices (a.k.a. “equipment”) in <a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#module-pyvvo.equipment" title="pyvvo.equipment"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.equipment</span></code></a>.
These classes generally contain a small subset of what’s contained in
the (<a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_resources/index.html#cim-documentation">CIM</a>).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_gridappsd/index.html#subscribe-to-simulation-output">Subscribing to simulation output</a>
is like drinking from a fire hose, so PyVVO has the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SimOutRouter</span></code> class
(<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#pyvvo.gridappsd_platform.SimOutRouter" title="pyvvo.gridappsd_platform.SimOutRouter"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.gridappsd_platform.SimOutRouter</span></code></a>) which filters
simulation output and calls methods of the equipment classes that keep
their states up to date (f). All state
updates/subscriptions occur in their own threads, so object states are
immediately updated whenever new measurements come in.</p>
<p>PyVVO uses <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gridlabd.org/">GridLAB-D</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Quick_links">Wiki</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d/">GitHub</a>) as its power flow solver/simulator, and the
GridAPPS-D platform is capable of creating a GridLAB-D model from the
CIM triplestore for its own simulations. PyVVO leverages this fact and
<a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_gridappsd/index.html#request-gridlab-d-base-file">requests a model</a> of the
power system in GridLAB-D (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.glm</span></code>) format (g),
representing the nominal state of the system.</p>
<p>Next, PyVVO initializes a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GLMManager</span></code>
(<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#pyvvo.glm.GLMManager" title="pyvvo.glm.GLMManager"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.glm.GLMManager</span></code></a>) (h) using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.glm</span></code> file pulled in (g). The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GLMManager</span></code>
creates an in-memory representation of the model using Python data
types, and is capable of modifying the model and writing out a new
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.glm</span></code> file. The module <a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#module-pyvvo.glm" title="pyvvo.glm"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.glm</span></code></a> could come in handy for
other GridAPPS-D applications, or any application that needs to read,
modify, and write GridLAB-D models. The code isn’t perfect and has some
shortcomings, but also has a <em>lot</em> of features and functionality.</p>
<p>Next, PyVVO begins the process of load modeling by pulling historic
meter data from the GridAPPS-D platform’s timeseries database
(i). Specifically, historic data should come from
the platform’s
<a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_gridappsd/index.html#query-sensor-service-data">sensor service</a>. As discussed in
<a class="reference internal" href="outstanding_work.html#todo"><span class="std std-ref">Outstanding Work, Known Issues, Future Work</span></a> and noted in the flow chart, this portion of PyVVO is
currently incomplete due to platform issues.</p>
<p>Weather data is incorporated in PyVVO’s load modeling process. This
data is obtained by
<a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_gridappsd/index.html#query-weather-data">querying the platform</a>
(j). Once obtained, the weather data must
be parsed and resampled so that it matches up 1:1 with the meter data
in (i). See
<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#pyvvo.timeseries.parse_weather" title="pyvvo.timeseries.parse_weather"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.timeseries.parse_weather()</span></code></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#pyvvo.timeseries.resample_timeseries" title="pyvvo.timeseries.resample_timeseries"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.timeseries.resample_timeseries()</span></code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optimization-phase">
<span id="opt-phase"></span><h3>Optimization Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#optimization-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First of all, note there is some overlap in the “Initialization” and
“Optimization” phases due to loop priming.</p>
<p>After all procedures described in <a class="reference internal" href="#init-phase"><span class="std std-ref">Initialization Phase</span></a> have been completed,
PyVVO enters its optimization loop. The first step in this process is
to update PyVVO’s internal <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.glm</span></code> model of the power system with the
current states of all equipment (l). Future
work might use predicted future states rather than current states.</p>
<p>Next, PyVVO initializes all the required objects for running the genetic
algorithm (m). The genetic algorithm components are fully
encapsulated in <a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#module-pyvvo.ga" title="pyvvo.ga"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.ga</span></code></a>. As noted in the flow chart, a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GAStopper</span></code> object is used for stopping the genetic algorithm
prematurely based on system events. At present, this only includes
switches changing state (though <cite>future work &lt;todo&gt;</cite> should include
other conditions). If the genetic algorithm were not halted due to a
topology change, it would continue optimizing, but its internal model
would no longer represent reality, making the result wrong/suboptimal
(and perhaps dangerous to the health of the system).</p>
<p>The internal workings of the genetic algorithm itself are rather
complex, so discussion here will be limited to what’s already mentioned
in (n). More details can be found in
<a class="reference internal" href="#genetic-algorithm"><span class="std std-ref">Genetic Algorithm</span></a>.</p>
<p>After the genetic algorithm has run to completion, PyVVO has an idea of
how controllable devices should be operated (<em>e.g.</em>, regulators and
capacitors). These proposed device settings are sent into the platform
as commands (<em>e.g.</em> put regulator 1, phase A at tap 3)
(o). PyVVO only sends in commands for proposed
states that are different from the current state. In this way, if the
proposed states are identical to the present states (indicating the
system is already in an “optimal” configuration), no commands are sent
into the system.</p>
<p>Note that (p) is flagged with <strong>INCOMPLETE</strong>. This is
because at present, PyVVO simply runs the optimization loop indefinitely
and only stops when its Docker container is killed. PyVVO doesn’t
presently require any particular clean-up procedures, hence why
(q) is so simple.</p>

<p>PyVVO uses “smart” meter data to create time varying predictive load

<p>While there are many, many types of load models, PyVVO attempts to keep
things simple and uses the ZIP load model. The ZIP load model represents
a load (or a collection of loads) as part constant impedance (Z), part
constant current (I), and part constant power (P). PyVVO uses the ZIP
load model for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ZIP load models have a voltage dependency, which is important for
model-based voltage control applications.</p></li>
<li><p>ZIP load models are included in as part of every distribution system
simulator under the sun.</p></li>
<li><p>ZIP load models are physics-based, as opposed to “black box” models.</p></li>
<li><p>ZIP load models only have a handful of parameters, making
curve-fitting less time consuming.</p></li>

models</p></li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/load_modeling.svg" src="_images/load_modeling.svg" /><p>The procedures described in the flow chart above can be kicked off by
instantiating a <a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#pyvvo.load_model.LoadModelManager" title="pyvvo.load_model.LoadModelManager"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.load_model.LoadModelManager</span></code></a> object
and then calling the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit_for_all</span></code> method. Note that the meta data
described in (c) are required inputs for
initializing a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LoadModelManager</span></code>. Also note that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_model</span></code>
module and associated code are in need of some more work, testing,
<em>documentation</em>, and attention.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the flow chart above speaks for itself. However,
some items that are worth elaborating on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As per usual, many of the parameters (<em>e.g.</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{cs}\)</span>) are
configurable. If the parameters aren’t already in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.json</span></code>,
they can easily be added and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/pyvvo#configuring-pyvvo">documented</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>At the time of writing, the data standardization in
(j) scale is unnecessarily done inside the
clustering and fitting loop. With some moderate refactoring, this
can be fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>K-means clustering in (k) is performed via
Scikit-learn’s <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means">implementation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that voltage (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span>) is not used in clustering, because
clustering by voltage will lead to a poorly performing ZIP model.
The ZIP load model takes voltage magnitude as input and outputs
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>. Therefore, it behooves us to have diverse
voltage values in the data used for fitting, which would be undercut
by including voltage as a clustering feature.</p></li>
<li><p>In (l), weather data is exclusively used as
cluster selection features. This is a heuristic assumption based on
the load/weather dependence that all power systems engineers are
well aware of. This has not necessarily been proven to be the best
approach in all scenarios, and in fact we’ve seen that at times a
better fit can be obtained by including <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> in
the cluster selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, we do not have a guarantee that our “best” cluster
necessarily leads to the “best” fit. However, it would be very
computationally expensive to perform a ZIP fit on every cluster.
On the other hand, maybe that approach would be worthwhile. There
is a wealth of experimentation that can still be done.</p></li>
<li><p>The least squares optimization routine mentioned in
(m) is moderately complex. It’s worth exploring this
code in detail. Simply follow the rabbit hole starting with
<a class="reference internal" href="pyvvo_code.html#pyvvo.zip.zip_fit" title="pyvvo.zip.zip_fit"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo.zip.zip_fit()</span></code></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The final ZIP model that comes out of (m) uses
GridLAB-D conventions. A thorough examination of the GridLAB-D
source code was undertaken to ensure exact concurrence. There are
tests to prove it in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tests/test_zip.py</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason for using a normalized MSE in (o) is that
different clustering loop runs will have a different number of
data points present in the “best” cluster, resulting in very
different raw MSE values.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that equal weight is given to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{MSE}_P\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{MSE}_Q\)</span> in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\text{MSE}_\text{norm}\)</span>
computation in (o). It may be valuable to experiment
with different weighting schemes.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="outstanding-work-and-possible-issues">
<h3>Outstanding Work and Possible Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#outstanding-work-and-possible-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The GridAPPS-D platform has struggled to put together a working sensor
service, and the timeseries database and its API have been plagued by
bugs. Additionally, memory leaks and other issues have prevented the
platform from running for a prolonged time to generate historic data
for the load modeling. As such, PyVVO’s load modeling procedures have
not been fully integrated into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app.py</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_model.py</span></code> has
several outstanding issues.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the underlying clustering and fitting code is complete (at
least in a working and tested draft form), and most of the remaining
work involves finalizing the touch points between PyVVO and the platform
with respect to load modeling.</p>
<p>It would be prudent to walk through the entire clustering and fitting
process with an eye toward performance optimization. There are <strong>many</strong>
loads in the so called “9500 node” model (~1300) and getting the
required data for each load requires 4 different measurement objects
(as mentioned in (d) in the flow chart).</p>
<p>I (Brandon) suspect that the load modeling procedure is going to run
into bottlenecks with respect to both I/O from the platform as well as
computation.</p>
<p id="io-issues"><strong>With respect to I/O</strong>: queries to the timeseries database
have to date been very slow, and message size and/or memory issues
means that it may be necessary to perform a single query for each load
(or maybe even for each measurement!) which comes with a <strong>lot</strong> of
overhead. Additionally, due to the primitive filtering available through
the GridAPPS-D API, there are two options for time filtering:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Pull all historic data at once (<em>e.g.</em>, all data for a two week
window) and filter it afterwards. Ultimately, PyVVO is only going
to use something like &lt; 1/10 of the pulled data, so this is clearly
inefficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform <em>lots</em> of little queries for the the various time windows.
<em>E.g.</em>, perform ten queries to pull data from 9:00am-11:00am for
two weeks worth of weekday data. This clearly comes with a lot of
overhead.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While it may go against the API-only “principles” of GridAPPS-D, the
best solution would be to query the timeseries database directly and
create moderately complex custom time filters. This could be done
through the API if a “custom query” route was created, similarly to
the <a class="reference external" href="https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_gridappsd/index.html#query">SPARQL API</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that if the historic data is ever generated at
the correct averaging interval by the sensor service (<em>e.g.</em>,
15 minutes), all the load data for a particular time window <em>might</em> fit
into memory with a single query. Again, you’re likely going to run into
maximum message size issues with the platform, although the database
itself would be totally happy to hand you all that data at once.</p>
<p>Finally, some thoughts on parallelization: depending on how the platform
API and database infrastructure are implemented, querying the database
in parallel on the application side may not result in truly parallel
queries on the platform side. <em>E.g.</em>, if the database queries are
multi-threaded instead of multi-processed, you won’t actually get true
concurrency, just the “fake” concurrency that threading provides.</p>
<p id="computation-issues"><strong>With respect to computation</strong>: The bottom line is there are a lot of
loads, and for each load multiple clustering operations and sequential
least squares optimization operations are run. That’s a lot of
computation. The good news is that this is <strong>completely</strong>
parallelizable. GridAPPS-D as a project is emphasizing distributed
applications, so splitting out the load modeling into its own app could
be a very valuable use case. This would also be useful for other
applications that rely on load models, such as WSU’s VVO application.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of tweaks that can be made to potentially speed
up the load modeling process. For example, increasing the minimum
cluster size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{cs}\)</span> in (i) will
decrease the number of clustering loops that are performed, at the cost
of less exploration. Additionally, the least-squares optimization could
potentially be sped up by using the previous fit parameters as a
starting point for the next optimization run. There are likely lots of
other little levers such as these that could help alleviate the
computation bottleneck.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling lazy and have the computational resources, just throw
more cores at the problem. However, depending on how you get the data,
you might run into I/O bottlenecks (as discussed in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#io-issues"><span class="std std-ref">IO issues</span></a> section.</p>
<p>If you are feeling really blasphemous and are okay flying in the face of
all the load modeling work that’s been done for this application, you
could do something as simple (and likely very, very suboptimal) as use
state estimator <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> output for each load and model
them all as constant power (or constant current or constant impedance
or with arbitrary ZIP parameters). Please don’t do this.</p>
<p>Yet another intriguing option would be to aggregate loads up to the
distribution transformer level. In short, one would need to model the
voltage drop and losses across the “triplex” lines, and then aggregate
at the historic data at transformer level. This aggregated data could
then go through the same ZIP fit procedure described here. However, you
lose some important information: what’s the voltage at each meter? It’s
feasible that downstream of one secondary transformer there’s one meter
within the allowed voltage band and one outside the allowed voltage
band. How often does this happen? Hard to say.</p>

<p>Brandon ran out of time to write about the genetic algorithm in detail,
but fortunately there’s this nifty flow chart:</p>
<img alt="_images/genetic_algorithm.svg" src="_images/genetic_algorithm.svg" /><p>Note that many genetic algorithm parameters are controlled in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyvvo_config.json</span></code>. Specifically, have a look at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ga</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">limits</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">costs</span></code> keys. Discussion of these parameters is
covered in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/pyvvo#configuring-pyvvo">README</a>.</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to follow along in the code with the flow chart in
hand. If you’re using PyCharm, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">B</span></code> is going to be your best
friend for jumping into methods as you follow the rabbit hole. As
seen in (b) and (c), the algorithm is
kicked off in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app.py</span></code>. From there, you can sift through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ga.py</span></code>
to find everything you need.</p>
<p>Note that right now, stopping the algorithm is ill-defined
(q). It just runs for a fixed number of generations.
Ideally, some sort of convergence criteria would be developed.</p>
