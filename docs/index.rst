Welcome to PyVVO's Documentation!
=================================

PyVVO is an example volt-var optimization (VVO) application written in
Python (hence the "Py") that runs on the GridAPPS-D platform. The
GridAPPS-D documentation can be found on `Read the Docs
<https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__.

While PyVVO is an "example" application, it is quite sophisticated, and
contains a lot of novel work in the sphere of load modeling and VVO.
