Testing
=======

PyVVO has a great many tests. This is necessary because, well, you
should always test your software. Also, it's a complex application,
and with any complex application you can't trust that it's working
without tests. This is also useful if a code modification is made -
the tests help ensure that something didn't get inadvertently broken
(though there's always room for hidden bugs that the tests don't
catch!). These tests have also caught countless platform bugs, and have
thus proven their worth in more than one dimension.

There are mentions of the tests in a couple places in the README:
:readme:`run-the-tests` and :readme:`run-the-tests-1` - please check
those out.
