    Reference:

    Power System Analysis and Design, 5th Edition, by Glover, Sarma, and
    Overbye

    In Section 2.2, power factor is defined as
    :math:`\\cos (\\delta - \\beta)` where :math:`\\delta - \\beta` is
    the angle between the voltage and current. If
    :math:`\\beta < \\delta`, then the power factor is lagging. If

    The power factor is positive by convention. If
    :math:`|\\delta - \\beta| > \\pi/2`, then the reference direction
    for the current may be reversed, resulting in a positive value of
    :math:`\\cos (\\delta - \\beta)`.

    In the case where the reference direction of current is reversed,
    we'll simply rotate our complex number by 180 degrees.
